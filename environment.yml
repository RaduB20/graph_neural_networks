  # Deep Learning (PyTorch Ecosystem)
  # Installs PyTorch with CUDA support for GPU acceleration (critical for GNNs)
  - pytorch
  - torchvision
  - torchaudio
  - pytorch-cuda=11.8  # Adjust this version if you have a different GPU driver

  # Graph Neural Networks (The most important)
  - pyg  # PyTorch Geometric (Includes GCN, GAT, MessagePassing layers)

  # Graph Data Handling & Visualization
  - networkx  # Essential for manipulating graph structures and simple plots
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn   # Better looking statistical plots

  # Standard Data Science Stack
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn  # For metrics (accuracy, F1) and simple baselines (logistic regression)
  - scipy
  - tqdm  # Progress bars (very useful for long training loops)

  # Optional but highly recommended for Hackathons
  - pip
  - pip:
    - ogb  # Open Graph Benchmark (Standard datasets often used in hackathons)
    - dgl  # Deep Graph Library (Alternative to PyG, just in case specific models need it)
    - tensorboard # To track your training loss live
